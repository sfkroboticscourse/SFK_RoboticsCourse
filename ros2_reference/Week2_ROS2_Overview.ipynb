    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "**ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2)** is an open-source framework for building robot software. Despite the name, it's **not** an operating system—it's a **middleware** that sits on top of Linux (or other OS).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Do We Need ROS2?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Building a robot from scratch is incredibly complex:\n",
    "- How do different parts communicate?\n",
    "- How do we visualize what the robot sees?\n",
    "- How do we test without breaking expensive hardware?\n",
    "- How do we reuse code from other projects?\n",

    "**Solution:** ROS2 provides:\n",
    "- **Standardized communication** between robot components\n",
    "- **Visualization tools** (RViz)\n",
    "- **Simulation** (Gazebo)\n",
    "- **Pre-built packages** for common tasks (navigation, perception, control)\n",
    "- **Active community** with thousands of open-source packages\n",
    "\n",
    "### ROS vs ROS2\n",
    "- **ROS (ROS1):** Released 2007, based on Python 2\n",
    "- **ROS2:** Released 2017, modern design with:\n",
    "  - Better real-time support\n",

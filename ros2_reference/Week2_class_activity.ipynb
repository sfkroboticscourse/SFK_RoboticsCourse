    "- `joint_state_publisher_gui` - Publishes joint positions when you move sliders\n",
    "- `robot_state_publisher` - Converts joint positions to 3D transforms\n",
    "- `rviz` - Visualizes the robot\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concept:** Each node does **one specific job**. Complex behavior comes from many nodes working together.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Topics?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **topic** is a **named communication channel** that nodes use to send/receive messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples we'll see today:**\n",
    "- `/joint_states` - Joint positions (angles, velocities)\n",
    "- `/robot_description` - The URDF content\n",
    "- `/tf` - Coordinate transforms\n",

    "5. **Publishers** send data, **Subscribers** receive data\n",
    "\n",
    "6. You can **monitor** topics with `ros2 topic echo`\n",
    "\n",
    "7. You can **publish** to topics with `ros2 topic pub`\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Joint positions** in the Mini Pupper are measured in radians\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Modifying the **URDF** changes what appears in RViz\n",
